# Privacy Policy

Li-Wei Yap built the Narradir app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Li-Wei Yap at no cost and is intended for use as is.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in my Terms and Conditions, which is accessible [here](https://github.com/liweiyap/narradir-android/blob/master/TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS.md) unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Personal Information Collection and Use

**I do not collect, use, or share your Personal Information, period.**

I physically can't. I have nowhere to store it. I don't even have a server database to store it. So even if Kim Jong-un asked nicely to see your data, I wouldn't have anything to show him.

Nonetheless, the app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

## Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service contains a link to my [personal website](https://liweiyap.github.io/). If you click on the link, you will be directed to that site. Whilst I do not collect, use, or share any of your Personal Information on my website either, the website is hosted on GitHub Pages. Please note that GitHub may collect User Personal Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service.
