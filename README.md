_Narradir_ [na-rey-deer] is designed to be used with the original _The Resistance: Avalon_ and _Secret Hitler_ board games. You will need at least one of these games, as well as an Android phone, in order to take advantage of this app.

This app automates the night-time narration based on the roles in your game. It offers the following improvements over similar apps out there:

* It allows the user to play a background sound during narration to help cover up any sounds made inadvertently by players.
* It allows the user to change the pause length during which certain characters have to perform their roles.
* In the case of _The Resistance: Avalon_, it provides a "smart" selection for the characters. As the number of players changes, the range of characters available for selection might also change. In addition, certain selection rules apply. Some characters will be automatically selected/deselected depending on the selection/deselection of other characters.

If, for whatever reason, one decides to download the source code and build it himself/herself, please note that there will be a build error because the raw resource MP3 file for the [crickets](https://soundbible.com/295-Summer-Crickets-Chirping.html) background sound is missing.

## Why the name _Narradir_?

The name is a portmanteau of _narrator_ and _Nadir_, which is the last name of Abed, one of the main characters of the American television sitcom [_Community_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)). In one episode involving delicious chicken fingers, Abed narrated a good chunk of the story line, as if "in a mafia movie" (his own words). In two other episodes featuring Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Abed was the Dungeon Master, whose tasks include narration. The launcher icon of the app is also a reference to the school logo of Greendale Community College, which is the main setting of this sitcom.
