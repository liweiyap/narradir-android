In addition, in a 5-player game, you cannot have Percival without either Morgana or Mordred.

    <string name="help_subheading1_subsubheading1">Background settings</string>
    <string name="help_subheading1_subsubheading1_para0">The Background Settings allows you to change the background sounds and their volume. These background sounds are played during the night phase (to help cover up any sounds made by players).\n</string>
    <string name="help_subheading1_subsubheading2">Role timer settings</string>
    <string name="help_subheading1_subsubheading2_para0">This timer determines the length of the pause during the action of the roles that wake up at night (namely Merlin, Percival, and/or the Agents of Evil).\n</string>

    <string name="help_subheading4">Why the name \"Narradir\"?</string>
    <string name="help_subheading4_para0">The name is a portmanteau of \"narrator\" and \"Nadir\", which is the last name of Abed, one of the main characters of the American television sitcom \"Community\". In one episode involving delicious chicken fingers, Abed narrated a good chunk of the story line, as if \"in a mafia movie\" (his own words). In two other episodes featuring Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Abed was the Dungeon Master, whose tasks include narration. The launcher icon of the app is also a reference to the school logo of Greendale Community College, which is the main setting of this sitcom.</string>
